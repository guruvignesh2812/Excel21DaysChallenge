# 📊 Excel Data Cleaning & Transformation Project  
### Using Microsoft Excel & Power Query

---

## 📌 Project Overview
![Excel](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c6604d19-c288-4dcf-9d8d-bdf034163765)

This project focuses on transforming a raw, unstructured dataset into a clean, structured, and analysis-ready format using Microsoft Excel and Power Query.

The goal was to simulate a real-world data preprocessing workflow where raw business data contains inconsistencies, duplicates, missing values, and incorrect data types.

This project demonstrates the complete data cleaning process before performing reporting, dashboarding, or business analysis.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Identify data inconsistencies
- Remove duplicate records
- Handle missing values
- Standardize text formatting
- Correct data types
- Create derived and conditional columns
- Automate cleaning steps using Power Query
- Prepare dataset for analysis and reporting

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

- Microsoft Excel
- Power Query Editor
- Excel Formulas (TRIM, CLEAN, PROPER, UPPER, LOWER)
- Sorting & Filtering
- Conditional Logic
- Data Validation

---

## 🔄 Data Cleaning Process

### 1️⃣ Data Understanding

- Reviewed dataset structure
- Identified formatting inconsistencies
- Checked for blank/null values
- Verified column data types
- Examined logical relationships between fields

---

### 2️⃣ Handling Missing Values

- Scanned dataset for blank cells
- Applied appropriate replacement strategy
- Ensured no incomplete critical records remained
- Validated dataset integrity after cleaning

---

### 3️⃣ Removing Duplicate Records

- Used Excel’s Remove Duplicates feature
- Verified unique identifiers
- Ensured no repeated transactional records
- Final dataset contains only unique rows

---

### 4️⃣ Standardizing Text Formatting

Applied text functions to ensure consistency:

- PROPER() → Standard capitalization
- UPPER() / LOWER() → Uniform text
- TRIM() → Removed extra spaces
- CLEAN() → Removed non-printable characters

This ensures professional and consistent formatting across the dataset.

---

### 5️⃣ Data Type Corrections

Converted columns to appropriate formats:

- Text → Number
- Text → Date
- General → Currency
- Applied decimal precision where required

This step ensures accurate calculations and prevents reporting errors.

---

## ⚡ Power Query Transformations

Power Query was used to create scalable and automated transformation steps.

### 🔹 Column Transformations

- Renamed columns for clarity
- Removed unnecessary fields
- Reordered columns logically
- Changed data types

---

### 🔹 Splitting & Merging Columns

- Split structured text fields
- Merged relevant columns
- Created formatted combined fields for reporting

---

### 🔹 Custom & Conditional Columns

Created new columns using:

- Logical conditions
- Mathematical calculations
- Categorization rules

Examples include:
- Profit-based classification
- Derived financial metrics
- Business rule-based tagging

---

### 🔹 Automation Using Applied Steps

All transformations were recorded in Power Query’s Applied Steps panel.

Benefits:
- Fully automated
- Refreshable with new data
- Scalable for larger datasets
- Repeatable cleaning process

---

## 📊 Data Validation & Quality Assurance

Post-cleaning validation included:

- Cross-checking totals
- Verifying numeric consistency
- Testing filters and sorting
- Confirming no duplicate entries
- Ensuring correct date and currency formatting

The dataset is now analysis-ready.

---

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

- Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Power Query Automation
- Logical Categorization
- Error Detection & Correction
- Data Quality Validation
